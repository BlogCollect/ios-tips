##  错误 implicitly declaring library function 'strncpy' with type
>	[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/977233/warning-incompatible-implicit-declaration-of-built-in-function-xyz](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/977233/warning-incompatible-implicit-declaration-of-built-in-function-xyz) 

n C, using a previously undeclared function constitutes an implicit declaration of the function. In an implicit declaration, the return type is int if I recall correctly. Now, GCC has built-in definitions for some standard functions. If an implicit declaration does not match the built-in definition, you get this warning.

To fix the problem, you have to declare the functions before using them; normally you do this by including the appropriate header. I recommend not to use the -fno-builtin-* flags if possible.

Instead of stdlib.h, you should try

```` #include <string.h> ````

That's where strcpy and strncpy are defined, at least according to the strcpy(2) man page.

The exit function is defined in stdlib.h, though, so I don't know what's going on there.

解决方法：添加头文件

````#import <objc/message.h> ````
